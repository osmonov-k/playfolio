# Wordle Clone

## Description

Wordle Clone is a web-based word-guessing game inspired by the popular game Wordle. The objective is to guess a hidden 5-letter word within 6 attempts. After each guess, the game provides feedback on the correctness of the letters, helping you narrow down the possibilities.

## How to Play

1. Start by entering a 5-letter word as your first guess.
2. After submitting your guess, the color of the tiles will change to indicate how close your guess was to the hidden word:
   - **Green**: The letter is correct and in the correct position.
   - **Yellow**: The letter is correct but in the wrong position.
   - **Gray**: The letter is not in the word at all.
3. Use the feedback to refine your next guess.
4. You have a total of 6 attempts to guess the correct word.

## Rules

- Each guess must be a valid 5-letter English word.
- You have 6 attempts to guess the hidden word.
- The game ends when you either guess the correct word or run out of attempts.

## Controls

- **Keyboard**: Type letters to input your guess.
- **Enter**: Submit your guess.
- **Backspace**: Delete the last letter.
